# Classification of Cancer Dataset by Logistic Regression

## Overview

This is an example of a machine learning implementation of identification by logistic regression. In this example, a dataset of 569 cancers is used to identify and predict whether each is malignant or benign. Malignant is labeled 0 and benign is labeled 1, each with 30 features. Because it identifies malignant and benign, it is called a two-class problem, for example.
