# Classification of Cancer Dataset by Logistic Regression

## Overview

This is an example of a machine learning implementation using logistic regression for classification. In this case, a dataset consisting of 569 instances of cancer is employed to predict whether each instance is malignant (labeled 0) or benign (labeled 1), based on 30 features of each instance. This problem is referred to as a two-class problem, given its task of distinguishing between malignant and benign cases.
